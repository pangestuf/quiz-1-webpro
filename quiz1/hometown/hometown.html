            <h1>Bekasi</h1>
            <p>Bekasi is a city in West Java, Indonesia, located on the eastern border of Jakarta. It serves as a commuter city within the Jakarta metropolitan area, although it has notable trade, business and processing industries. According to the 2018 estimation by Statistics Indonesia (BPS), Bekasi (2.93 million) has already overtaken Surabaya (2,89 million) as the second most populous city proper, within the largest metro in Indonesia. The city is bordered by Bekasi Regency to the north and the east, Bogor Regency and Depok to the south, and East Jakarta to the west. It is Indonesia's most populous satellite city, and one of the most populous worldwide.</p>
            <p>Bekasi is one of the oldest cities in Indonesia, and has a history of being the capital city of the Kingdom of Tarumanagara. At that time, the name of Bekasi was Dayeuh Sundasembawa. The earliest evidence of its existence dates from the 5th century according to the Tugu inscription. During the Dutch East Indies period, Bekasi was a part of Batavia residency. As a dormitory city, many middle-up satellite areas have been developed in Bekasi, complete with their own shopping malls, schools, hospitals, club houses, water park, and shuttle bus services to central Jakarta. The large number of multinational companies, has apparently attracted many expatriates to settle in Bekasi.</p>
